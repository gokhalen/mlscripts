-2) Checkpointing Keras (saving and resuming training)
-1) ml.py: Save prediction and add options to only post process 
0) Check if classification is being carried out correctly
2) Compute percentages for training examples and total examples separately
4) modify mlsetup to generate data with no homogneous examples - check if setting nhomo to zero will do this
5) Breast mesh using GMSH and prediction from displacement images of breast
