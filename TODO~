#       Confusion matrix
#       Predict - stiffness values of inclusion
#               - center and **radius** of inclusion
#       classification: decide which region tumor falls into
#       feature scaling
#       predict stiffness,radius,and center
#       predict binary (yes/no) and stiffness,radius,and center
