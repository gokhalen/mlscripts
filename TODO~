
-101) Check if strain images can predict stiffness (np.diff)
-100) Post Process all data sets (ntrain,ntest,nvalid)
-99)  Regularization for layers





-11) Validation loss is actually increasing with iterations for value prediction
-10) Saving best weights
-9) Use the sigmoid function to restrict range of values of mu between mumin and mumax
-8) Look at other peoples' Network architectures
-7) Learning rate
-6) Feature scaling for 'value'
-5) Checkpointing and restarting the model
-4) Supplying initial guess to the optimization algorithm
-3) Reduce indent in JSON to speed up disk IO
-2) Checkpointing Keras (saving and resuming training)
-1) ml.py: Save prediction and add options to only post process 
0) Check if classification is being carried out correctly
2) Compute percentages for training examples and total examples separately
4) modify mlsetup to generate data with no homogneous examples - check if setting nhomo to zero will do this
5) Breast mesh using GMSH and prediction from displacement images of breast
